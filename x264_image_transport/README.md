x264_image_transport
====================

This software is derived from the ROS packages made available by IntRoLab, Universite De Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

Specifically, it provides a catkinized image transport plugin for recent versions of ROS, using x264 encoding.

Installation
============
Under current releases of ubuntu, system installed ffmpeg libraries are too old to support this software. To get around this, do the following (tested under ROS Indigo and Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty):

1. Rename/remove any previously build ffmpeg libraries installed in your home directory under ~/ffmpeg_build

2. Rebuild ffmpeg with shared libraries enabled and install them under ~/ffmpeg_build - this can be done using the included build_ffmpeg.sh script

3. Ensure that the built libraries are on path by adding

  "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/ffmpeg_build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  
  to the bottom of your .bashrc file.

4. build the project using catkin_make

5. test by running: roslaunch x264_image_transport test_x264.launch
